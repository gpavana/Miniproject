# REAL TIME DRIVER FATIGUE ALERT SYSTEM
Driver fatigue and drowsiness are major causes of road accidents, necessitating an automated, real-time drowsiness detection system that accurately monitors drivers and alerts them to early signs of fatigue, as traditional methods often prove ineffective.
## About
Drowsiness while driving is a major cause of road accidents, especially among drivers who operate vehicles for extended periods, such as truck and bus drivers. ​
This issue results in thousands of injuries and crashes worldwide each year, with severe consequences. ​
Developing technologies to detect and prevent driver drowsiness is a critical challenge in accident prevention systems. ​
The objective of this project is to create a simulation that models a drowsiness detection system, which provides alerts specifically when the driver’s eyes are closed, aiming to reduce such accidents effectively. 

## Features
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Calculation**: Measures eye openness to detect prolonged eye closure, indicating potential drowsiness.
- **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) Calculation**: Detects yawning by measuring mouth openness as a sign of drowsiness.
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Uses Dlib to detect faces and landmarks in live video frames.
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Identifies key points around eyes and mouth to calculate EAR and MAR.
- **Drowsiness Alert System**: Triggers an audio alarm if drowsiness is detected based on EAR or MAR thresholds.
- **GUI with Streamlit**: Provides a user-friendly interface with Start/Stop buttons and real-time feedback on drowsiness.
- **Video Overlay with OpenCV**: Displays live video with annotated EAR/MAR values, alerts, and eye/mouth status.
- **Multithreading for Alarm**: Plays alarm sound on a separate thread to avoid interrupting video processing.


## Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - Webcam (1080p recommended)
  - CPU: Intel i5 or better
  - RAM: 4 GB (8 GB recommended)
  - Speakers (for alarm)
  - Optional: NVIDIA GPU
- **Software**:
  - OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux
  - Python 3.7+
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
  - OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
  - Dlib: `pip install dlib`
  - Imutils: `pip install imutils`
  - SciPy: `pip install scipy`
  - Pygame: `pip install pygame`
- **Optional**:
  - CMake (for Dlib installation): `sudo apt-get install cmake`
  - CUDA (for GPU acceleration, if needed)

## Results and Impact
### Key Features

- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Dlib accurately detects facial points, ensuring precise eye and mouth tracking.
- **EAR & MAR Calculations**: Euclidean distance helps accurately detect closed eyes and yawning. EAR drop and high MAR correlate with drowsiness events.
- **Convex Hull Visualization**: OpenCV highlights eye and mouth regions effectively in real-time.
- **Real-Time Alarm System**: Pygame triggers alarms promptly upon detecting drowsiness.
